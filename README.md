This is a template to write nvim plugin in Rust, also a part of a workshop in [COSCUP 2020](https://coscup.org/2020/zh-TW/).

Here is the [slides](https://slides.com/yanganto/coscup2020-rustgears).  

I hope you have fun with Rust.

Thanks daa84 contribute [neovim-lib](https://github.com/daa84/neovim-lib), such that written a Rust nevim plug is realy easy.
